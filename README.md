# Unhandled Error in Next.js 15 API Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 API routes:  unhandled exceptions.  The `api/data.js` route contains an asynchronous function that might throw an error.  Without proper error handling, this error will not be gracefully caught and handled, possibly leading to a 500 Internal Server Error with minimal information.

The solution showcases how to use async/await and try...catch blocks to handle such errors properly and return informative error responses to the client.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Access the API route: `http://localhost:3000/api/data`
5. Observe the results; approximately half the requests will fail silently or with minimal error details.  The solution demonstrates how to improve the error handling.
